This is a python script that will eventually be used to automate the process of booking multi-person rooms at the library.

There are 2 ASP links that must be traversed and then the form to be filled out for multiple people.

Currently the first link is succesfully "clicked"

Progress on the second one requires an efficient and organized way to traverse and interact with an html table in python
