This is a python script used to automate the process of booking a library room at UOIT

It uses selenium and a chromedriver at the moment. Requests a time and day, and finds the first available room with those specifications,

as well as 4 consecutive available timeslots. It also adds a second person, although there are still a few boundary cases that need to be worked out.





Any student number password combinations that are needed should be added to STUDENT INFORMATION at the top of the file.
